Finally! The moment we've all been waiting for! ðŸŽ‰ The time has come to embark on a new adventure to save Christmas! ðŸŽ„

Similar as previous years, we'll be using the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges to practice
our coding skills. This year, we'll be using C++ as our main language, but we'll also be using other languages to solve
the challenges.

[@fefas](https://blog.fefas.dev/){: class="external no-highlight"} and I will be blogging about our solutions, 
and we'll cross-reference each other's posts. So keep an eye on both of our blogs! ðŸ¤“

The code repository is available at [malukenho/aoc2023](https://github.com/malukenho/aoc2023){: class="external no-highlight"}.
