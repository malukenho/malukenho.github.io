## Day 01: Trebuchet?!

{: class="marginalia" }
\* Cf. [aoc. d. i xxiii](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

To solve the first day's challenge, we need to find the first and last digit of
each line, combine them, and then sum them all up with the result of the other lines. *

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c"}
```cpp
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

Given the input `1abc2`: `1` and `2` are the first and last digits, respectively.
So we put them together and we get `12`. We do this for each line, and then we sum
them all up.

### PART 1

{% include tip.html content="I'm going to be honest with you, It was quite a 
challenge to solve this problem. I'm not proficient in C++. I'm actually learning
it as we go through the challenge, so I had to do a lot of research in between
the solutions." %}

I've started by solving the problem for a single line. The logic is quite simple:
we iterate over the line, and if the current character is a digit, we check if
the first digit is empty. If it is, we assign the current character to it.

{: class="marginalia" }
Î±

We always update the last digit with the current character, so at the end of the
iteration, we'll have the first and last digits of the line.

{% capture first_content %}

This is how our linear solution looks like:

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c"}
```cpp
static int part1(string &calibration_values) {
    int sum = 0;
    char first_digit = ' ';
    char last_digit = ' ';

    for (char &current_char: calibration_values) {
        if (current_char >= '0' && current_char <= '9') {
            if (first_digit == ' ') first_digit = current_char;
            last_digit = currentChar;
        };
    }
    
    sum = (sum + (first_digit - '0') * 10 + (last_digit - '0'));

    return sum;
}
```

{% endcapture %}


{% capture second_content %}

Our two pointers approach is arguably more efficient than the linear solution.
But it is lengthier and maybe harder to understand.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c"}
```cpp
static int part1(string &input) {
    int ans = 0;
    char right = ' ';
    char left = ' ';

    int rp = 0;
    int lp = input.size() - 1;

    while (rp < input.size() && lp > 0) {
        if (input[rp] == '\n') {
            if (right != ' ') ans += (right - '0') * 10;
            right = ' ';
        }

        if (input[lp] == '\n') {
            if (left != ' ') ans += left - '0';
            left = ' ';
        }

        if (input[rp] >= '0' && input[rp] <= '9') {
            if (right == ' ') right = input[rp];
        };

        if (input[lp] >= '0' && input[lp] <= '9') {
            if (left == ' ') left = input[lp];
        };

        rp++;
        lp--;
    }

    if (right != ' ') ans += (right - '0') * 10;
    if (left != ' ') ans += left - '0';

    return ans;
}
```

{% endcapture %}

That looks good! We can solve the problem for a single line. Now we need to
make sure we can solve it for multiple lines. One way to do that is to calculate
and reset the `first` and `last` variables after each new line `\n`.

{: class="marginalia" }

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c" from="13" to="28"}
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static int part1(string &input) {
        int ans = 0;
        char first = ' ';
        char last = ' ';

        for (char &i: input) {
            // Reset first and last when we find a new line
            if (i == '\n') {
                if (first != ' ' && last != ' ') {
                    ans = (ans + (first - '0') * 10 + (last - '0'));
                }
                first = ' ';
                last = ' ';
                continue;
            }

            if (i >= '0' && i <= '9') {
                if (first == ' ') first = i;
                last = i;
            };
        }

        ans = (ans + (first - '0') * 10 + (last - '0'));

        return ans;
    }
};
```

In that way we can solve the problem for multiple lines in `O(n)`.

With that we unlock the second part of the challenge and won our first star! ðŸŒŸ

### PART 2

In the second part of the challenge, we discovered that the digit can actually be
spelled out with words. So both `1` and `one` are valid digits.

The way I decided to go about it was to create a map with all the spelled out digits
and their respective values * containing the numeric digit.

{: class="marginalia" }
\* Some people were having trouble with the overlapping digits.
For example `twone` should be a match for `2` and `1`.
That means that we can't just replace the whole spelled out digit, we need to
leave the chars that can be used to form other digits.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c"}
```cpp
 unordered_map<string, string> C = {
     {"one",   "o1e"},
     {"two",   "t2o"},
     {"three", "t3e"},
     {"four",  "f4r"},
     {"five",  "f5e"},
     {"six",   "s6x"},
     {"seven", "s7n"},
     {"eight", "e8t"},
     {"nine",  "n9e"},
 };
```

Now we can iterate over the map and replace the spelled out digits with their
respective numeric digits.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c"}
```cpp
for (auto &i: C) {
   unsigned long pos = input.find(i.first);
   while (pos != string::npos) {
       input.replace(pos, i.first.size(), i.second);
       pos = input.find(i.first);
   }
}
```

Now we can use the same logic as before to find the first and last digits of each
line and sum them up.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" mode="c" from="34" to="56"}
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    static int part1(string &input) {
        int ans = 0;
        char first = ' ';
        char last = ' ';

        for (char &i: input) {
            if (i == '\n') {
                if (first != ' ' && last != ' ') {
                    ans = (ans + (first - '0') * 10 + (last - '0'));
                }
                first = ' ';
                last = ' ';
                continue;
            }

            if (i >= '0' && i <= '9') {
                if (first == ' ') first = i;
                last = i;
            };
        }

        ans = (ans + (first - '0') * 10 + (last - '0'));

        return ans;
    }

    static int part2(string &input) {
        unordered_map<string, string> C = {
            {"one",   "o1e"},
            {"two",   "t2o"},
            {"three", "t3e"},
            {"four",  "f4r"},
            {"five",  "f5e"},
            {"six",   "s6x"},
            {"seven", "s7n"},
            {"eight", "e8t"},
            {"nine",  "n9e"},
        };

        for (auto &i: C) {
            unsigned long pos = input.find(i.first);
            while (pos != string::npos) {
                input.replace(pos, i.first.size(), i.second);
                pos = input.find(i.first);
            }
        }

        return part1(input);
    }
};
```

And with that we unlock the second star! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

<div class="footnotes">
    <p>
        Î±) we could also try a two pointer approach to find the first and the last digits.
        One pointer goes from right to left <code>right++</code>, and the other goes left
        to right <code>left--</code>. They both would stop once they found a digit and don't
        overlap with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        Î²) using a two pointers approach would make the solution more confusing and harder
        to understand, because we would need to track the single digits with the left pointer,
        and the double digits with the right pointer.
