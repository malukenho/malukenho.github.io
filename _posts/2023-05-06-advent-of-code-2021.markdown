## Day 2: Dive!

I'll take you through my thought process as I approached this challenge and explain how I came up with my
solution. So, grab a cup of coffee and let's dive into the challenge! ☕️

If you want to go straight to the code, you can check it out on
our [codelicia's repository](https://github.com/codelicia/adventofcode/tree/main/2021).

If you did not read the problem for the day yet, you can access it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2){:

### Part 1

As always the first thing we need to do is to parse the input. The input for this problem is a list of strings. Each
string represents a command to the submarine. The command is composed by an orientation and a number. The orientation
can be `forward`, `up`, `down`. The number is the distance the submarine should move in the given orientation.

My first thought was to represent each direction as a tuple. The first element of the tuple would be the orientation and
the second element would be the distance.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" from="1" to="10"}
```kotlin
class Day02(plannedCourse: List<String>) {

    val submarine =
        plannedCourse
            .map {
                val (orientation, to) = it.split(" ")
                orientation to to.toInt()
            }
            
}

fun Day02.submarine(): List<Pair<String, Int>> = this.submarine

fun main(): Unit = println(Day02(listOf( "forward 5", "down 5", "forward 8", "up 3", "down 8", "forward 2" )).submarine())
```

If you think about it, we don't need to iterate over the list of commands and increment/decrement the depth. We can
just sum all the distances and subtract the `up` distances from the `down` distances. The result will be the depth of
the submarine.

I've created a helper function `sumOfCoordinate` to sum all the distances of a given orientation.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" from="9" to="12"}
```kotlin
class Day02(plannedCourse: List<String>) {

    val submarine =
        plannedCourse
            .map {
                val (orientation, to) = it.split(" ")
                orientation to to.toInt()
            }
            
    private fun List<Pair<String, Int>>.sumOfCoordinate(coordinate: String): Int =
        this.filter { it.first == coordinate }.sumOf { it.second }
        
}

fun Day02.submarine(): List<Pair<String, Int>> = this.submarine

fun main(): Unit = println(Day02(listOf( "forward 5", "down 5", "forward 8", "up 3", "down 8", "forward 2" )).submarine())
```

Now we can use the `sumOfCoordinate` function to calculate the depth of the submarine. When multiplying by the `forward`
it will give us the distance traveled by the submarine.

{: class="language-kotlin" theme="darcula" from="13" to="17"}
```kotlin
class Day02(plannedCourse: List<String>) {

    val submarine =
        plannedCourse
            .map {
                val (orientation, to) = it.split(" ")
                orientation to to.toInt()
            }
            
    private fun List<Pair<String, Int>>.sumOfCoordinate(coordinate: String): Int =
        this.filter { it.first == coordinate }.sumOf { it.second }
        
    fun part1(): Int =
        submarine.sumOfCoordinate("down")
            .minus(submarine.sumOfCoordinate("up"))
            .times(submarine.sumOfCoordinate("forward"))
}

fun Day02.submarine(): List<Pair<String, Int>> = this.submarine

fun main(): Unit = println(Day02(listOf( "forward 5", "down 5", "forward 8", "up 3", "down 8", "forward 2" )).part1())
```

We've got our first star! 🌟
